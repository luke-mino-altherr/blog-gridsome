I am currently a lead software engineer at [Known](https://known.is). Known was born out of a consulting company called [Schireson](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-science--strategy-firm-schireson-acquires-stun-creative--blackbird-to-form-known----a-new-breed-of-modern-marketing-company-300999494.html).  

Since 2017, I have primarily worked on ViacomCBS's advanced advertising platform, [Vantage](https://google.com/search?q=Vantage+ViacomCBS&tbm=nws). As the earliest engineer on the project, I helped build the product's core application components, as well as the underlying AWS infrastructure, CICD processes, and critical data processing pipelines. I happily work across the stack which is largely comprised of a frontend written in Vue/Typescript, backend APIs built with Tornado and Flask, workers written with Kombu and brokered by RabbitMQ, backing stores in Postgres/Redshift/Athena, data processing tasks coordinated by Airflow, and microservices orechestrated by Kubernetes.

Before Known, I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University. During my time there, I was lucky enough to work as a software engineer on [Project Calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/) at Metaswitch Networks, as a software engineer on the Radar DSP team at Raytheon, and as a hardware engineer at [VideoIQ](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/videoiq).

Outside of the professional, corporate world. I have a deep appreciation for creative technology. In my freetime, I am often collaging audio and sythesizing sounds with both hardware and software devices. I also develop new tools to further enrich my creative endeavors.
