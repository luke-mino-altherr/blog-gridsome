Known was born out of a consulting company called <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/data-science--strategy-firm-schireson-acquires-stun-creative--blackbird-to-form-known----a-new-breed-of-modern-marketing-company-300999494.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Schireson</a>.  </p>\n<p>Since 2017, I have primarily worked on ViacomCBS's advanced advertising platform, <a href=\"https://google.com/search?q=Vantage+ViacomCBS&#x26;tbm=nws\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Vantage</a>. As the earliest engineer on the project, I helped build the product's core application components, as well as the underlying AWS infrastructure, CICD processes, and critical data processing pipelines. I happily work across the stack which is largely comprised of a frontend written in Vue/Typescript, backend APIs built with Tornado and Flask, workers written with Kombu and brokered by RabbitMQ, backing stores in Postgres/Redshift/Athena, data processing tasks coordinated by Airflow, and microservices orechestrated by Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>Before Known, I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University. During my time there, I was lucky enough to work as a software engineer on <a href=\"https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Project Calico</a> at Metaswitch Networks, as a software engineer on the Radar DSP team at Raytheon, and as a hardware engineer at <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/videoiq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">VideoIQ</a>.</p>\n<p>Outside of the professional, corporate world. I have a deep appreciation for creative technology. In my freetime, I am often collaging audio and sythesizing sounds with both hardware and software devices. I also develop new tools to further enrich my creative endeavors.</p>\n"}}]}},"context":{}}
